    When it comes to websites, there are a lot of options out there for getting your business
    online. Nowadays, there are free website builders that virtually anyone can use to get a website
    up and running in as little as 10 minutes. There are also a ton of agencies and individuals out
    there that can build you a website. With such an abundance of choices, what option works best
    for you to get your website up and running?
</p>

The answer to this question is not a straightforward one. Much like every other decision that you will make, there are a lot of things to consider when choosing the best website option for your needs. Your budget and your goals are at the forefront of your decision; however there are a lot of other options to consider as well.

Sure, you could just throw together a website using a free builder or a free WordPress template, but this will take time and effort on your part to set up and maintain. You could hire a full-service agency to get the best possible website and strategy for your business - but this comes with a high price tag. Or you can go right down the middle and hire a freelancer to build your site.

By entrusting a freelancer to design and build your site, you get the advantage of a high-quality, professional site and the support you need to get your site launched and keep it running - all at a cost that better fits within your budget.

So how do you pick the right option for your needs? To help you make this decision, let’s take a look at some pros and cons of each of these three options: a DIY website, an agency-built website, and hiring a freelancer.

## The DIY Route

As I mentioned, there are dozens of free or cheap DIY website solutions out there. Everything from website builders to customizable templates and themes. Most of these services let you get up and running with a basic website in as little as 10 minutes. But they may not be the best options for your website.

    <div class="md:border-r-2 md:border-gray-400/45 md:pe-8">
        <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Pros</h3>
        <ul class="space-y-4">
            <li>**Cheap.** In fact, a lot of website builders offer a free service. If you do opt to pay for a website, you can find options that range from just a few dollars per month to hundreds of dollars per month. It just depends on what you are looking for.</li>
            <li>**Easy to do.** Most DIY website builders will offer free or _“freemium”_ drag-and-drop editors, so that you can build a site with little more knowledge than typing a word document.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="md:ps-8">
        <h3 class="text-xl mb-2">Cons</h3>

        <ul class="space-y-4">
            <li>**Limited features and functionality.** Most pre-built and site builder options are very limited on their features - especially if you opt for a free or low-cost option. You are pretty much limited to the features of the template that you choose.</li>
            <li>**Time consuming.** While you can build a website in as little as 10 minutes, the amount of time involved in researching the right site builder, troubleshooting any issues, and keeping your site maintained after it is live is valuable time that could be better spent on building your business instead.</li>
            <li>**Limited support.** Free and cheap website builders often come with very limited support. Maybe you can fill out a contact form and receive a response in a day or two, but for the most part you are on your own - especially when it comes to optimizing and marketing your website.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

## Hiring an Agency

There are a lot of full service design agencies out there - from local ones in your town to national (and even international) brands. The key benefit of an agency is that you get a one-stop-shop for all of your website, branding, and marketing needs. Medium and larger agencies have large teams dedicated to the success of your website, and some agencies can also provide you with a dedicated support contact. But agencies do come at a price that is often out of reach for the typical small business.

<div class='grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 font-light text-base space-y-4 mb-4'>
    <div class='md:border-r-2 md:border-gray-400/45 md:pe-8'>
        <h3 class='text-xl mb-2'>Pros</h3>
        <ul class='space-y-4'>
            <li>
                **A fully dedicated team beside you every step of the way,** backed by years of
                experience and education.
            </li>
            <li>
                **Complete customizability.** Working with an agency means that no feature is too
                large or small.
            </li>
            <li>
                **Quick turn-around.** Agencies will often have many employees, specializing in
                different areas - all working on your website. This gives you a fast turn-around
                time on your project.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class='md:ps-8'>
        <h3 class='text-xl mb-2'>Cons</h3>
        <ul class='space-y-4'>
            <li>
                **Agencies come with the highest price tags.** Afterall, they have a lot of
                employees that all need to be paid. When hiring an agency, expect to pay tens of
                thousands of dollars for a high quality website. Even smaller agencies tend to
                require a large investment.
            </li>
            <li>
                The high price tag often puts a full-service agency out of reach for small and
                medium businesses and entrepreneurs.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

## Hiring a Freelancer

The third and final option that I want to talk about is the freelance option. A freelancer might just be the “happy medium” that you need to get your website up and running. Freelancers are often solo-prenuers, and therefore have a lot less overhead than a full-service agency. As far as quality, hiring the right freelancer also means getting someone with the experience and expertise to help provide you the best solution.

<div class='grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 font-light text-base space-y-4 mb-4'>
    <div class='md:border-r-2 md:border-gray-400/45 md:pe-8'>
        <h3 class='text-xl mb-2'>Pros</h3>
        <ul class='space-y-4'>
            <li>
                **A more sophisticated and modern design.** A good freelancer won’t sell you a
                __“cookie cutter”__ template website. You get a customized design that is tailored
                to your individual needs.
            </li>
            <li>
                **More features.** A freelancer can completely customize your site and offer you
                more features and functionality than a DIY solution.
            </li>
            <li>
                **The support you need on launch day and beyond.** A huge benefit of hiring a
                freelancer is that you get the support you need to make sure that your site works as
                it is supposed to once it is live. Most freelancers also offer support and
                maintenance plans with their services, so you can rest assured knowing that you have
                support when you need it.
            </li>
            <li>
                **Expertise when you need it.** A good freelancer that is well-versed in web design
                and development will be able to answer any questions you have and provide you with
                suggestions for best practices and best results when building your website.
            </li>
            <li>
                **An excellent balance between cost and value.** While the cost investment of a
                freelance developer is higher than a DIY solution, it is certainly more affordable
                for most businesses than an agency. The financial investment in a freelancer also
                guarantees a higher quality website.
            </li>
            <li>
                **Good freelancers are not just web developers;** they are technical consultants,
                ready to answer your questions and help you solve your online needs.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class='md:ps-8'>
        <h3 class='text-xl mb-2'>Cons</h3>
        <ul class='space-y-4'>
            **Can have a waitlist.** Because freelancers are typically solo-prenuers, they can often
            have a long list of client projects to work on. This means that your project could take
            a bit longer to get started.
        </ul>
    </div>
</div>

## So which option is right for you?

There is a lot to consider when looking for the best solution for your website needs.

If you are looking for a cheap way to get up and running, you might try a DIY site builder. It will get the job done, but as your audience and your site grow, you will find yourself putting in more of your time and effort maintaining the site.

If you have a large budget and want the very best of the best when it comes to websites and branding, you might consider hiring a full-service agency to build your site. A good quality agency will treat you like you are their only client - but you will also be billed as such. Hiring an agency to build your site is like hiring a team of full-time developers to work on your site, and it comes at a cost.

Perhaps the best approach for you is to partner up with a good quality freelancer. This will give you the expertise that you need to craft a high quality website and the support you need to make sure your site works and continues to work, all at a price that is reasonable for your budget and needs.

This is the approach that I recommend - especially if you are a small or medium business that is looking to establish or re-design your online presence and start reaching more visitors.

It is important, however, to keep in mind that not all freelancers are created equal. When it comes to choosing the right freelancer, remember that __**you get what you pay for**__. A cheap freelancer will give you a website, but may not be able to offer you the best quality, since they need to focus on more projects and clients at a time.
